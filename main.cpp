  /*
   Shared_ptr is also a form of smart pointer. It's purpose is to allow creation
   of multiple pointers referring to the same thing!
   
   RAW POINTER equivalent of what is happening above:
   dog* snoopy = new dog("Snoopy");
   dog* peanut = &snoopy;
   
   Here I created peanuts, a nickname for snoopy. I called its copy constructor
   to copy Snoopy's memory address over to peanuts. Now whatever peanuts does
   is what Snoopy wil do!
   
   Shared_ptrs have the benefit of memory management, just like unique_ptr.
   Except, it will go 1 step further. It will go through all the shared_ptr
   linked together and deallocate them all at once.
   
   This means I no longer have to call  "delete" on snoopy or peanut. It will
   do it by itself. And if an exception occured, it will automatically
   deallocate all the pointers referring to Snoopy!
